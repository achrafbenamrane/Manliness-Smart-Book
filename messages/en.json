    "brotherhoodTitle": "Brotherhood Over Ego",
    "brotherhoodText1": "Ancient warriors understood that individual glory meant nothing if your brothers fell. The Roman shield wall worked because each man protected the man beside him. The Spartan phalanx was unbreakable because no one wanted to be the weak link.",
